{"google":"","body":"## Overview\r\n\r\n**Crouton**, is a class that can be used by Android developers that feel the need for an alternative to the Context insensitive [Toast](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/Toast.html).\r\n\r\nThe name and the idea of [Crouton](https://github.com/neofoniemobile/Crouton/blob/master/src/de/neofonie/mobile/app/android/widget/crouton/Crouton.java) originates in a [blog article](http://android.cyrilmottier.com/?p=773) by Cyrill Mottier.\r\n\r\nA Crouton will be displayed at the top of an application window.\r\nYou can line up multiple Croutons for display, that will be shown one after another.\r\n\r\nThe current implementation requires the Holo theme to be present on the device.\r\n\r\n### Examples\r\nCurrently you can use the three different Style attributes displayed below:\r\n\r\n![Alert](https://github.com/neofoniemobile/Crouton/raw/master/res/Alert.png \"Example of Style.ALERT\")\r\n\r\n![Confirm](https://github.com/neofoniemobile/Crouton/raw/master/res/Confirm.png \"Example of Style.CONFIRM\")\r\n\r\n![Info](https://github.com/neofoniemobile/Crouton/raw/master/res/Info.png \"Example of Style.INFO\")\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\n\r\nThe API is kept as simple as the Toast API:\r\n\r\nCreate a Crouton for any CharSequence:\r\n\r\n    Crouton.makeText(Activity, CharSequence, Style).show();\r\n    \r\nCreate a Crouton with a String from your application's resources:\r\n\r\n    Crouton.makeText(Activity, int, Style).show();\r\n\r\nYou can also cancel scheduled Croutons by calling:\r\n\r\n    Crouton.cancelAllCroutons();\r\n\r\n### Extension and Modification\r\n\r\nColor and display duration of a Crouton is defined by [Style](https://github.com/neofoniemobile/Crouton/blob/master/src/de/neofonie/mobile/app/android/widget/crouton/Style.java).\r\nYou can easily create your own Styles by adding them to the existing enum.\r\n\r\nIf you want to modify the general appearance you might want to have a look at the [ViewHolder](https://github.com/neofoniemobile/Crouton/blob/master/src/de/neofonie/mobile/app/android/widget/crouton/ViewHolder.java).\r\n\r\n### License\r\n\r\n######Croutons are licensed under the **[Apache License, Version 2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html)**.\r\n\r\nCopyright 2012 Neofonie Mobile GmbH\r\n\r\n   Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\r\n   you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\r\n   You may obtain a copy of the License at\r\n\r\n       http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\r\n\r\n   Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\r\n   distributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\r\n   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\r\n   See the License for the specific language governing permissions and\r\n   limitations under the License.\r\n\r\n####The initial version was written by Benjamin Weiss at Neofonie Mobile GmbH.","name":"Crouton","tagline":"Context sensitive notifications for Android  ","note":"Don't delete this file!
